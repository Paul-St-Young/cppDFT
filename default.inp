DFT:
    L           5.0     # box size in Bohr
    Ecut        2.0     # plane wave cutoff in Hatree
    maxBasis    100     # max number of basis (should be calculated from L and Ecut)
    ngrid       23      # number of points per dimension of real space grid, must be odd to avoid 1/r being 0
    
CPMD:
